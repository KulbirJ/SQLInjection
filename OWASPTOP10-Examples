=======================================
2. Broken Authentication 
Mitigation:
  1. MFA
  2. Strong password or use of passphrases 
  3. Rate-Limit login attempts 
  4. Blacklist IPs
  5. Cross-reference passwords against common leaks for e.g. https://haveibeenpwned.com/
  6. Use server side session management 
 
RealWorld Examples 
  1. Uber failed to rate limit : https://hackerone.com/reports/281344
  2. Errorneous logic in Shopfiy's web app: https://hackerone.com/reports/270981
  
==================================================
3. Sensitive Data Exposure 
Mitigation:
  1. Indentify all sensitive data and know where and how it is stored. 
  2. Do not store sensitive data where is no longer needed. 
  3. Data at rest is encrypted with stong alogrithms using cryptographic keys genereted using strong passwords 
  4. Data in transit uses TLS, perfect forward secrecy ciphers and http strick transport security.
  5. Store passwords using strong salted hasing functions. 
  
 RealWorld Examples 
  1. Login Form on Chaturbate usign http: https://hackerone.com/reports/386735
  2. Secure Flag on set for cookiies : https://hackerone.com/reports/345166

  3. Avoid serialisation of sensitive data. 
  4. Don't run old xml libraries or processors. 
  5. Avoid SOAP version <1.2
  6. Impose server side filterring on XML. 
  7. Perform static applicaiton security testing.
